## Omnisyndetic Framework

**Omnisyndetics** is a novel experiment in relational ontology, proposing that identity, structure, and reality itself emerge fundamentally through the act of *distinction*. It rigorously rejects the notion of substance or form existing independently of relation, positing instead that all actuality arises from the collapse of undifferentiated potential into coherent configuration.

This framework is grounded in the following foundational premise:

> **To be is to be distinguishable, and all distinction is relational.**

### Observation and Collapse

Within the Omnisyndetic model, *observation* is not understood as passive reception or measurement, but as the **active, ontological act of structural distinction**.

The observer is not an external agent but an operational condition: wherever distinction occurs, observation has already taken place. This act *precedes consciousness*, as consciousness itself must be observed and delineated through contrast.

The **observation-collapse operator** is formally defined as:

```
O : P → S

where O(ψ) = s
```

- **P**: The undifferentiated space of latent potential  
- **S**: The domain of coherent, actualised structures  
- **ψ**: A potential configuration  
- **O**: The act of collapse; resolution into distinguishable form

> No form exists prior to collapse.  
> There is no identity without relation,  
> and no relation
