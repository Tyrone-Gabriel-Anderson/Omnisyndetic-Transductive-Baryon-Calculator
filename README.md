# omnisyndetic-transductive-baryon-calculator
A fully relational, coefficient-free baryon identity calculator based on the Omnisyndetic and Transductive Coherence Ontology. Computes mass, charge, coherence, and field energy from geometric deviation alone â€” no particles, no constants, just structural emergence.
