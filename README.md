# Omnisyndetic-Transductive-Coherence: Relational Baryonic Identity Calculator  
### Geometry-Based Simulation of Mass, Charge, and Collapse

This repository contains the **first official implementation** of the Transductive Relational Calculators — a series of geometric physics tools developed as part of the Omnisyndetic Framework. This initial release simulates the formation, stability, and collapse of **baryonic identity** from first geometric principles — using only deviation from perfect closure as its input.

No force laws, no particles, no interactions.  
Only curvature, coherence, and return.

## Scope of This Tool

This release models the baryonic triad only — the minimal structure capable of recursive identity under the Omnisyndetic ontology. It simulates:

- Identity formation via geometric return
- Emergence of mass, charge, and field radius
- Collapse thresholds when coherence fails
- Tachyonic conditions when projection exceeds stability
- Gravitational memory residue upon identity failure

This is **Calculator 1** in the full toolchain. Future calculators will address:

- Mesonic bridges  
- Baryon fusion dynamics  
- Relational field PDEs in higher topologies  
- Ontological time and temporal symmetry

## What This Simulator Does

For any triadic configuration (3-relational structure), this simulator computes:

### ▸ Inputs:
- Radial coherence scale $\lambda$
- Total angular sum $\sum \varphi$
- Normalised deviations:
  - Angular: $\epsilon$
  - Radial: $R_{\text{dev}}$

### ▸ Core Calculations:
- Relational curvature: $\kappa = \epsilon^2 + R_{\text{dev}}^2$
- Coherence scalar: $C = e^{-\kappa}$
- Total emergent mass $m^*$
- Projected charge $q$
- Residual field energy $E_{\text{field}}$
- Return time $\tau$
- Gravitational potential: $\Phi = 1 - e^{-\kappa}$

### ▸ Critical Phenomena:
- Collapse detection when $C < C_{\text{min}}$
- Mass vanishing at quantised curvature limits
- Tachyonic reversal when $C > C_{\text{max}}$
- Gravitational residue emergence as a memory field

##  Ontological Basis

This simulator does **not** use:

- Particle models  
- Force interactions  
- Field mediators  
- Fitted coefficients  

Instead, it derives all phenomena from pure closure geometry — comparing the identity structure to **Plato’s Baryon**, the ideal recursive loop.

Every output is based solely on deviation from perfect return:

\[
\kappa = \left( \frac{|\sum \varphi - 2\pi|}{2\pi} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\lambda - \lambda_0}{\lambda_0} \right)^2
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
C = e^{-\kappa}
\]

##  Research Context

This calculator, framework and all equations derived were developed independently by **Tyrone Gabriel Anderson** and is based on the ontological and mathematical structure presented in:

Tyrone Gabriel Anderson. (2025). Principia Transductiva: The Axioms of Relational Coherence in the Omnisyndetic Framework. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15213184

Tyrone Gabriel Anderson. (2025). The Geometry of Observation: Defining the Fundamental Shapes of Transductive Coherence in the Omnisyndetic Framework. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15211376

These papers detail the mathematical logic of identity recursion, the emergence of physical quantities from relational deviation, and the reformulation of gravity as irreversible coherence failure.

## Using the Calculator

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Open the Unity project or run the included WebGL build
3. Adjust:
   - Angular closure $\sum \varphi$
   - Radial coherence length $\lambda$
4. Watch in real-time:
   - Baryon formation or collapse
   - Mass and charge projection
   - Emergence of curvature fields
5. Export state logs or screenshots to match simulation to analytic predictions

##  Simulation Validation

All thresholds and behaviours are rigorously matched to theoretical predictions, including:

Property | Predicted From | Validation Status
Mass (m*) | ε, R_dev → κ → C → E_total | ✅ Matches expected curves
Charge (q) | ε sign + λ scaling | ✅ Polarity + decay validated
Curvature (κ) | ε² + R_dev² | ✅ Analytical match ±0.01
Coherence (C) | exp(−κ) | ✅ Exactly traced
Cloud Radius (r_cloud) | r₀ × log(1 + κ) | ✅ Radius plots confirmed
Gravitational Potential (Φ) | 1 − exp(−κ) | ✅ Field edge reproduced
Divergence (Λ) | ε⁴ / λ² | ✅ Follows gradient prediction
Decay Width (Γ) | Γ = (ħ / E_mem) · exp(−κ/κ_max) | ✅ Aligned with lifetime drop
Lifetime (τ) | 1 / Γ | ✅ Peak near stability band
Coupling Strength (α) | α = (ε² + δ²) / (...) | ✅ Smooth gradient verified
Collapse Point | C < C_min ≈ 0.8423 | ✅ Triggers correctly
Tachyon Threshold | λ < λ₀ | ✅ Inversion detected

##  What’s Next

Future calculators will expand the model to:

- Recursive field PDEs for distributed systems
- Ontological time states and lifetime convergence
- Higher identity systems beyond baryons
- Structural unification with quantum geometry

These are in development and will be released as part of the extended **Omnisyndetic Calculator Series**.


##  Full Ontological Architecture

All outputs are consistent with the Omnisyndetic interpretation of reality:

Symbol | Output Name | Ontological Role | Formula / Definition
ε | Angular Deviation | Source of charge; feedback imbalance | `ε =
R_dev | Radial Deviation | Failure of spatial return | R_dev = (λ − λ₀) / λ₀
κ | Ontological Curvature | Total structural tension | κ = ε² + R_dev²
C | Coherence Scalar | Fidelity of identity return | C = exp(−κ)
δ | Residual Torsion | Irreducible curvature remainder | δ = √(1 − C)
m* | Emergent Mass | Stored curvature energy | m* = E_loop + E_desire + E_field
q | Emergent Charge | Projected asymmetry of angular mismatch | q ∝ sign(Δφ) · ε⁶ / λ (simplified)
E_loop | Loop Validation Energy | Energy from identity recursion | Computed from α, δ, λ, C
E_desire | Desire Energy | Projection energy from return failure | From under-closure curvature
E_field | Echonex Field Energy | Curvature memory encoded into space | E_field = Λ × α × (1 + δ) × MeV₀
r_cloud | Charge Radius | Spatial echo of incomplete identity | r = r₀ × (1 + log(1 + κ))
Φ | Gravitational Potential | Scalar memory of failed closure | Φ = 1 − exp(−κ)
Λ | Divergence Scalar | Projection of curvature difference | Λ = ε⁴ / λ²
τ | Lifetime | Time before identity collapses | τ = 1 / Γ, with decay width from E_mem
α | Coupling Strength | Ratio of internal tension to radial scale | α = (ε² + δ²) / (ε² + δ² + λ²)
μ² | Curvature Density Constant | PDE source term for Helmholtz collapse | μ² = E_G / ħc
Ψ | Coherence Field Amplitude | Field of returnability across identity space | PDE: ∂Ψ/∂t = −∇²Ψ + V_grav Ψ
These are not secondary effects — they are the **first expressions of identity** in space.
