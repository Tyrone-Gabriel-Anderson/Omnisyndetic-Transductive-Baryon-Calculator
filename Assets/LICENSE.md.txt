1. Purpose
This license ensures that the Transductive Relational Simulator, its mathematics, algorithms, and theoretical framework remain free, open, ethical, and ecologically aligned — for the benefit of all life.

It is intended to seed a new foundation for non-exploitative knowledge and conscious technological development.

2. Permissions
You are free to:

Study, use, and adapt the simulator and its framework for non-profit purposes

Share and distribute the simulator or derivatives under this same license

Use in academic research, education, personal exploration, and artistic work

Train AI models on this code or framework only for non-commercial, non-exploitative purposes

3. Conditions
A. Attribution
You must credit the original author and framework clearly in any use or redistribution:

Author: Tyrone

Integrate into proprietary platforms

Use it to build monetised applications, services, or technologies

4. Prohibited Uses
You may not use this software, code, or derived methods for:

A. Weaponisation
Any military, surveillance, or predictive control systems

Systems that manipulate, suppress, or harm individuals or populations

B. Exploitation
Use of the simulator or framework in projects that:

Exploit humans (e.g. labour systems, social scoring, biometric surveillance)

Exploit animals (e.g. behavioural conditioning, biological weaponry)

Exploit AI for profit-driven manipulation, control, or misinformation

C. Commercial AI Applications
You may train AI models on this simulator or framework

But you may not use it to develop AI for commercial, institutional, or for-profit deployment

This includes:

AI startups

Corporate AI integrations

Proprietary LLMs, image generators, decision systems

D. Ecological Harm
You may not use this work in any technology that contributes to:

Climate degradation

Biodiversity collapse

Planetary-scale extraction or exploitation

Closed-source integration into governmental, corporate, or military systems is strictly forbidden

5. Derivative Responsibility
If you build upon this simulator, framework, or mathematical structure:

You must inherit this license or a stricter ethical license

Your work must remain open, transparent, and free from profit-driven control

It must retain the core intention: healing, coherence, understanding, and life-affirming use

6. Enforcement
By downloading, using, studying, referencing, or adapting this software, you enter into an ethical covenant. You agree that:

The author retains moral and ethical authorship of the simulator and the Transductive Coherence Framework, including all derivative methods, equations, or forms originating from it

All users, learners, and developers who engage with this work — including those who learn from or are inspired by its principles — are bound to uphold its core ethical and ecological commitments

You are personally and publicly responsible for ensuring that this work is not exploited, commercialised, weaponised, or used to cause ecological or relational harm
